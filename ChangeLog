	* commitment.py (commit): Fix test case, given that now constant is not base64-encoded

	* watch_remotegrity_bb.py Start by getting most recent hash of saved files, so on restart we don't save duplicates

	* watch_remotegrity_bb.py randomize sleep intervals

	* remove files that are identical to the previously-downloaded file
	* watch the two rss files also

	* wrote watch_remotegrity_bb.py to download the bulletin boards and save only when new

	* meeting2.py: set correct_windows=False when processing random
	seed file, since in 2011 the original file was generated on Linux
	rather than Windows.  This should instead be fixed instead by
	using "universal newline" from PEP 0278 both in the file_in_dir()
	function and in get_latest_djia_stock_prices.py.

	* add set_meeting_two_random_data() in filenames.py to allow specifying random data file
	  and use it in meeting2.py and meeting4.py
